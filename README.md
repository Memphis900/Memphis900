## INTRODUCTION

Hello, and welcome to my Github profile! My name is **Memphis Milne** and I am a 15 year old *aspiring* full-stack developer!

## About me

I find It worth mentioning I have **Tourettes syndrome**, and although it does not effect my ability to learn/program, it can be noticable, I have many coping mechanisms to prevent it from becoming too much for myself and others!

In addition I am based in the United Kingdom (Land of tea)!

## Links

I have a few links I will like to share with you all.
