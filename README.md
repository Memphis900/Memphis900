# Introduction
Hey there, reader! I'm Memphis, and I'm currently 15 years old as of writing this (7/6/2023). I've got this passion for programming, and whenever I have free time, I love diving into the world of coding. Right now, I'm pretty comfortable with Python, and I've also dipped my toes into SQL, but I've still got a lot to learn in that department.


# My Aspirations
I've got big dreams of becoming a kick-ass front-end developer. To make that happen, there's a whole bunch of stuff I need to get under my belt:

• I gotta nail down the basics of computer science.

• Understanding how the web works is essential.

• HTML, CSS, and JS are my bread and butter, so I want to be a pro at those.

• Web security is a must-know for me.

• SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is something I need to master.

• Version control with Git is crucial.

• I want to dive into the world of jQuery and leverage its power.

• Typescript is something I need to explore and get comfortable with.

• When it comes to frameworks, I've got my eyes on React, Angular, or Vue.

• Bootstrap is gonna be super handy for me.

• And last but not least, I want to rock it with SASS for efficient styling.

I'm all ears for any suggestions or feedback you might have. Seriously, if I mess something up or if there's a better way to do things, please let me know!

# About Me

My name's Memphis, and let me tell you, I'm obsessed with programming. I got into it when I was around 12 years old, starting with Python. Then, I thought being a back-end developer was my calling, so I jumped into SQL. Right now, I'm diving into the world of HTML and CSS, and yeah, I'm pretty much a newbie in that area (シ).

Oh, by the way, I've got Tourette's syndrome, but that doesn't stop me from pursuing my passion.

I'm based in the United Kingdom, living it up in this awesome country.

Thanks for taking the time to get to know my aspirations and a bit about me. I appreciate you giving me your attention, and I'm stoked to continue this journey!
